# Nalu examples

To run the examples:

* install nalu: [https://github.com/FrankHossfeld/nalu-parent] and follow the instructions

* clone the repository

* run ```mvn clean``` & ```mvn gwt:devmode```

* copy the link and paste the link into the browser url


I have tested the examples on OS X with Safari, Chrome and FireFox.


## Notes

Some things are nonsens and only implemented to test the features.


If Bart Simpson is selected from the list, the application will route to the search view. This is the desired behavior: see ```BartSimpsonFilter````
